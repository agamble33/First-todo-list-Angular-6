Name: Anthony's todo list 
Version 6 (angular)
Description: basic todo list with input for what you want to create and the children(sublist). The result of the list you create includes: Title, Date, description, status and options where you can delete or store.

System requirements. Angular 6 Typescript 3.0, Node Js updated to latest version
Install, uninstall, configuration, and operating instructions: going to push to my github and send readme.txt file

All edits were done under src/app and added to models todo.ts and service.ts 

Known bugs and a change log: so I have the hardest time dealing with animation function in a new component so i found a way around not using that component. I also had a hard time with import { Observable } from ‘rxjs’ in the component.ts file, kept getting error. I was lucking that alot people had same issue.
I think with more time I can create a detailed todo list with database and mobile capabilities thank you.
